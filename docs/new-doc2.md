The OMG smart contract address

It's not possible to make transactions from the contract address; your tokens are lost to all
The wrong token address on an exchange	You can try contacting the exchange with the details of your transaction, but OmiseGO has no power to reverse the transaction or force the exchange to return your tokens.
A scammer	There's nothing we can do to get your tokens back. We do our best to report scam accounts, so feel free to let us know if you see a suspicious account or website, but we can’t catch them all and can’t take responsibility for their actions.
Some other address that you don’t have access to	No one except the holder of the private keys associated with that address will be able to help you get your tokens back. Unless the person who received them is exceptionally honest and decides to give them back, those tokens are lost for good.
