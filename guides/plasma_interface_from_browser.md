# Get to know the Plasma Interface

Estimated time: 5 minutes

Goal:

- To understand plasma transactions from end-to-end

Click Okay and there should be a popup that shows the message you are trying to sign- here you can inspect the inputs and outputs of your transactions. After making sure this is accurate, click Confirm.

3.2. To see the status of your transaction. You could also open up your browser console and retrieve the TX hash, by searching for the hash through [Plasma Block Explorer](http://quest.samrong.omg.network) you should see the details of the transaction.
